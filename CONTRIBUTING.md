Unsure where to begin contributing to Jenny? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/star-3gg/sellana-shop-data-tools/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/star-3gg/sellana-shop-data-tools/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests üì¶

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Jenny's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Jenny
- Enable a sustainable system for Jenny's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps for your contribution:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
